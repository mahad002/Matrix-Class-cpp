# Matrix-Class-cpp

Implementation of Matrix Class – Your goal is to implement a generic “Matrix" class. You will need to write three
files (matrix.h, matrix.cpp and Q2.cpp). Your implemented class must fully provide the definitions of following class
(interface) functions. Please also write down the test code to drive your class implementation. Please note that we
will be running your code against our test code and any segmentation faults or incorrect result will result in loss of
marks.
